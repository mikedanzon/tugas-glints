# Detect Ball Challenge (empty or not)

- Create a class Ball
- Ball objects should accept one argument for "ball type" when instantiated
- If no arguments are given, ball objects should instantiate with a "ball type" of "regular"

Example:
<const ball1 = new Ball();>
<const ball2 = new Ball("super")>

it should be return
<ball1.ballType> = "regular" 
<ball1.ballType> = "super"
